Instructor Notes:
- Nodes are the individual participants in the network (i.e., running instances of the app)
- In Challenge 1, students will see multiple nodes in the Playground
- The validation and gossip aspects are key to Holochain's security model
- Each node validates a subset of the DHT, providing efficient verification
- The redundancy provides fault tolerance and resilience
- The links to additional concepts help curious students explore further
