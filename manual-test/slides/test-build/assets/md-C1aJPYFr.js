Instructor Notes:
- Entries are the actual data being stored (vs actions which are operations)
- Use the "nouns" analogy to contrast with actions as "verbs"
- Entries are defined by the app developer (in Challenge 1, the Joke entry)
- Content-addressable storage is a key concept - identical content = identical hash
- The combination of actions and entries creates records in the source chain
- In Challenge 1, students will work with Joke entries - creating, updating, and deleting them
