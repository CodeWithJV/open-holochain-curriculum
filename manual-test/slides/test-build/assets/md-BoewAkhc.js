Instructor Notes:
- Agents are the actors in the system (usually humans operating the app)
- Each agent has a unique cryptographic identity (their agent key)
- The agent-id + DNA = cell (the specific instance of the app for that agent)
- All actions are signed by the agent's private key, providing cryptographic attribution
- The source chain is a key concept - it's the immutable record of all the agent's actions
- In Challenge 1, students will see multiple agents creating and sharing jokes
