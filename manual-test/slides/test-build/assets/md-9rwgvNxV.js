Instructor Notes:
- This summary table provides a quick reference for all the key concepts
- It's helpful for students to see how all the pieces fit together
- Each concept is linked to the glossary for further reading
- This is a good slide to refer back to when students have questions
- These concepts provide the foundation for Challenge 1
- Consider having students explain these concepts in their own words
