Instructor Notes:
- Actions are the fundamental state change mechanism in Holochain
- Every time an agent does something, it's recorded as an action
- Actions are signed by the agent, creating cryptographic accountability
- The chain of actions creates the tamper-evident ledger
- The "verbs" analogy helps students understand how actions relate to operations
- In Challenge 1, students will implement create, update, and delete actions
